# deisa_example
An example how to use deisa 
 ## Requirement :
- distributed repo : https://github.com/GueroudjiAmal/distributed

- the timedim should be the first poition in an array :
  exp : 
  array.shape = (x,y,z); where x in the max timesteps and 0 is the timedim.

- for the momemnt no way to control the worker memory 
  I'll se how to manage that later, for the moment we have to pay attention to the size of the data we sent to the workers at once

## Done
- No time loop in the analytics  
- Multiple arrays can be sent
- No metadata exchange
- Deisa plugin 
- Scatter with key 
- I kept the MPI chunk size, so it sould parallelize finer than a task per timestep, we can check the graphs generated by deisa and for an empty array
